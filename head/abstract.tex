\chapter*{Abstract}

The search for triboson production of two massive bosons, of which at least one \PZ, and a photon is presented.
The analysis is performed exploiting the full dataset collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC
in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$ in the 2016--2018 period,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $137\fbinv$.
The cross section of the production of four leptons, either electrons or muons, and a photon is measured
with a significance exceeding 5 standard deviations,
in a phase space where $\PZ\PZ\PGg$ production with leptonic decays of the \PZ bosons is enhanced,
and is found to be in agreement with the Standard Model predictions.
Evidence is found for the production of two Z bosons and a photon
and the exclusive cross section of the process is measured.
Preliminary results for the measurement of the production of
three leptons, a neutrino and a photon are also presented,
in a region of the phase space where the simultaneous production of a $\PW\PZ\PGg$ is enhanced.
