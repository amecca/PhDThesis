In order to ensure that the electron trajectories are consistent with a common primary vertex
they are required to have an associated track with a small impact parameter with respect to the event primary vertex.
The significance of the impact parameter (SIP) is used:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SIP3D}
\SIPthreeD \mathdefined \frac{|\rm IP_{3D}|}{\sigma_{\rm IP}} \ ,
\end{equation}
where ${\rm IP_{3D}}$ is the lepton impact parameter in three dimensions,
that is the distance with respect to the primary interaction vertex the point of closest approach,
and $\sigma_{\rm IP}$ the associated uncertainty.
Electrons for the analysis must satisfy $\SIPthreeD < 4$.
