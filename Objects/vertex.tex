The pp collision vertices in an event are reconstructed by grouping tracks consistent with originating at a common point in the luminous region.
The candidate vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object $\pt^2$ is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex.
The physics objects are the jets, clustered using the \antikt jet finding algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp, Cacciari:2011ma} with all the tracks assigned to candidate vertices as inputs,
and the associated missing transverse momentum, taken as the negative vector \pt sum of those jets.
