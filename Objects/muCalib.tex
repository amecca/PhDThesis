Similar to electrons the muon momentum scale is measured in data by fitting a Crystal-ball function to the di-muon mass spectrum around the Z peak in the 
$Z \rightarrow \mu\mu$ control region. Results of this procedure year per year can be found in
\todo{cite $HiggsAN,CMS_AN_2016-442,CMS_AN_2017-342$}.
%At the moment no muon scale and resolution corrections are available but from 
%Fig.~\ref{fig:mu_energy_scaleA},~\ref{fig:mu_energy_scaleB} and~\ref{fig:mu_energy_scaleC} shows a very good agreement between data and simulation, for 2016, 2017 and 2018 eras, respectively. %even without any corrections.
