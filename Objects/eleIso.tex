The electron isolation is archieved through the use of the Particle Flow relative isolation,
described in Equation \todo{ref{eq:RelPFIso}}.
%% was optimized in Ref.~\cite{AN-15-277} and the electron isolation working was
The threshold for the electron isolation is
chosen to be $\text{RelPFiso}(\Delta R = 0.3) < 0.35$.
