A Particle Flow based isolation is used to suppress the contamination from muon from hadronic decays inside jets.
The so-called $\Delta\beta$ correction is applied in order to subtract the \pileup{} contribution for the muons, 
whereby $\Delta\beta = \frac{1}{2} \sum^\text{charged had.}_\text{PU} \pt$
gives an estimate of the energy deposit of neutral particles (hadrons and photons) from \pileup{} vertices.

The relative isolation for muons is then defined as:
\begin{equation}
\text{RelPFIso} = \frac{1}{\pt^\text{muon}} \left( \sum_\text{charged had.} \pt + \max(0, \sum_\text{neutral had.} \ET + \sum_\text{photon} \ET - \Delta \beta) \right)
\label{eqn:mupfiso}
\end{equation}

where the sums run over the photons, charged and neutral hadrons in a cone with $\DR = 0.3$ around the muon.
Only charged hadrons originating from the primary vertex are included to minimise the \pileup{} contribution.

The isolation cone for muons was optimised and the working point was chosen to be $\text{RelPFiso}(\Delta R = 0.3) < 0.35$. 

Similarly to electrons, a condition on the significance of the 3D impact parameter (\SIPthreeD, see Equation \ref{eq:SIP3D}) is applied,
in order to ensure that muons are consistent with the primary vertex.
Muons are required to satisfy $\SIPthreeD < 4$.
