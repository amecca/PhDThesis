\label{sec:fake_leptons}
To estimate the expected fake lepton background yield in the signal region,
dedicated control regions are defined with requirements similar to the signal region, but in such a way that they do not to contain signal events.
To enhance the \nonprompt lepton component, events in these regions are required to
have a number of leptons that fail the tight selection, while passing the loose criteria.
The other selections are identical to maintain similarity with the signal region.

The fake lepton background yield in the signal region is extrapolated from these regions
according to the probability for loose lepton candidates to pass also the final selection criteria,
defined in Sections~\ref{sec:ele_selection} and~\ref{sec:muo_selection} for electrons and muons respectively.
These probabilities, referred to as fake rates, are estimated independently as illustrated in the following section.

\paragraph{Lepton fake rate application\\}
Once the fake rates are estimated they are used to reweight the events
in dedicated control regions (alternatively called application regions).
