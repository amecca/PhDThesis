In the four lepton channel %% , in addition to a few rare processes that result in the same final state as the signal,
the main backgrounds in the signal region are fake leptons and fake photons.
Both can either be estimated using the data-driven methods described in Sections~\ref{sec:fake_leptons} and~\ref{sec:fake_photons_background} respectively, or using the simulation.

For the fake photons, the samples used for the estimation, \eg $\qqZZnonpro$ for the four lepton channel, contain only prompt leptons,
and therefore the fake lepton background must be considered separately, for example with the data-driven method for leptons described in Section~\ref{sec:fake_leptons}.
On the other hand, the application region for the data-driven estimate of the \nonprompt photon background, CR4P\_1F,
already contains some \nonprompt lepton events, which contribute to the fake photons estimate.

Therefore, when the fake photon data-driven estimate is used,
the contribution of \nonprompt leptons estimated from the leptonic control regions, \eg CR3P1F and CR2P2F for the four lepton channel,
is not added to the total background.
