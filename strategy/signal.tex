\label{sec:signal}
This analysis searches for the simultaneous production of two massive bosons and a photon in a single hard scattering of a proton-proton collision at 13\TeV.
The signature of these processes varies among the three channels, but includes a number of high-momentum, isolated leptons,
with one or two pairs resonating to the Z boson mass,
and an isolated photon with high momentum.

The massive bosons are not stable particles and the most simple process that includes the VV\PGg production is 2 fermions $\to$ 4 fermions + a photon.
All Feynman diagrams with the same perturbative order, the minimal case being $\text{O}(\alpha_{EW}^5)\times\text{O}(\alpha_{QCD}^0)$,
must be taken into account in the generation of the signal process,
resulting in a certain degree of ambiguity in what can be considered triboson production when a photon is present in the final state.
We can classify the diagrams into three classes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The photon is radiated from an initial state fermion (Figure~\ref{fig:ppTo4LG_hard}), a case that includes Initial State Radiation (ISR) diagrams.
\item The photon emerges from a Triple or Quartic Gauge Coupling (e.g. Figure~\ref{fig:ppTo4LG_GC}).
\item The photon is emitted as Final State Radiation (FSR) by one of the leptons from the decay of a vector boson (e.g. Figure~\ref{fig:ppTo4LG_FSR}).
\end{enumerate}
Arguably, only the first and second process are strictly considerable triboson production.

The goal of this analysis is to measure both the cross sections and the significance of the inclusive processes
$pp \to 4\Pl \PGg$, $pp \to 3\Pl \PGnl \PGg$ and $pp \to 2\Pl 2j \PGg$
and of triboson production
in a region where diagrams of che classes 1 and 2 are enhanced.
Therefore a dedicated cut %% , described in Section \ref{sec:FSR_cut},
was devised to suppress events in which the (genuine) photon comes from final state radiation,
and results are derived both with (\textbf{triboson fiducial region}) and without (\textbf{inclusive cross section region}) applying it.

It is worth noting that in the SM only $\PW\PZ\PGg$ can be produced via triple and quartic gauge couplings,
while $\PZ\PZ\PGg$ does not have any leading order (perturbative expansion up to $\alpha_{EW}^5$) contribution from TGC nor QGC.

\paragraph{Signal components\\}
The relative composition of the diagrams shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ppTo4LG} in the signal sample was assessed in a generator level study.
The study is conducted on the four lepton channel, but the results can be generalised to the other two.
Two samples were generated at Leading Order EW ($\alpha_{\rm EW}^5 \, \alpS^0$) using \MADGRAPH.
The first is the inclusive production of four fermions and a photon, while the other constrains the intermediate vector boson state.

More precisely, the first sample simulates the process $\Pp\Pp \to 2\Pe 2\PGm \PGg$,
which in \MADGRAPH syntax corresponds to \verb|generate p p > e+ e- mu+ mu- a|.
The photon may be attached either to an initial- or final-state fermion line,
but not to a triple or quartic vertex since there are no suitable couplings in the SM for this final state.
The choice of a final state where the two lepton pairs have different flavour
excludes the interference from diagrams with the momenta of two leptons swapped.
The computed cross section is $0.075 \fbinv$.

The second sample forces the intermediate Z boson resonances $\Pp\Pp \to \PZ\PZ\PGg \to 2\Pe 2\PGm \PGg$,
using the syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
define ze = z
define zmu = z
generate p p > ze zmu a, ze > e+ e-, zmu > mu+ mu-
\end{verbatim}
In this case the photon is forced to be directly attached to an initial-state fermion line,
making this a sub-sample of the previous one.
The computed cross section is $0.027 \fbinv$.

The distributions of the invariant mass of the same-flavour opposite-sign lepton pairs and the transverse momentum of the photon
for the first and second sample are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:genstudy}.
From these plots it appears that in a sizeable fraction of FSR events the mass of one of the
reconstructed $\Pl\Pl$ pairs is significantly lower than the \PZ peak.
It is also visible that the transverse momentum of FSR photons tends to be lower,
since the momentum of the lepton may change significantly,
and it becomes almost zero above $80\GeVc$.
However only a fraction of the events in both samples are in the tail with $\pt^\PGg > 80\GeVc$.
