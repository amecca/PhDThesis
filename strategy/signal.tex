\label{sec:signal}
This analysis searches for the simultaneous production of two massive bosons and a photon in a single hard scattering of a proton-proton collision at 13\TeV.
The signature of these processes varies among the three channels, but includes a number of high-momentum, isolated leptons,
with one or two pairs resonating to the Z boson mass,
and an isolated photon with high momentum.

The massive bosons are not stable particles and the most simple process that includes the VV\PGg production is 2 fermions $\to$ 4 fermions + a photon.
All Feynman diagrams with the same perturbative order, the minimal case being $\text{O}(\alpha_{EW}^5)\times\text{O}(\alpha_{QCD}^0)$,
must be taken into account in the generation of the signal process,
resulting in a certain degree of ambiguity in what can be considered triboson production when a photon is present in the final state.
We can classify the diagrams into three classes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The photon is radiated from an initial state fermion (Figure~\ref{fig:ppTo4LG_hard}), a case that includes Initial State Radiation (ISR) diagrams.
\item The photon emerges from a Triple or Quartic Gauge Coupling (e.g. Figure~\ref{fig:ppTo4LG_GC}).
\item The photon is emitted as Final State Radiation (FSR) by one of the leptons from the decay of a vector boson (e.g. Figure~\ref{fig:ppTo4LG_FSR}).
\end{enumerate}
Arguably, only the first and second process are strictly considerable triboson production.

The goal of this analysis is to measure both the cross sections and the significance of the inclusive processes
$pp \to 4\Pl \PGg$, $pp \to 3\Pl \PGnl \PGg$ and $pp \to 2\Pl 2j \PGg$
and of triboson production
in a region where diagrams of che classes 1 and 2 are enhanced.
Therefore a dedicated cut %% , described in Section \ref{sec:FSR_cut},
was devised to suppress events in which the (genuine) photon comes from final state radiation,
and results are derived both with (\textbf{triboson fiducial region}) and without (\textbf{inclusive cross section region}) applying it.

It is worth noting that in the SM only $\PW\PZ\PGg$ can be produced via triple and quartic gauge couplings,
while $\PZ\PZ\PGg$ does not have any leading order (perturbative expansion up to $\alpha_{EW}^5$) contribution from TGC nor QGC.
