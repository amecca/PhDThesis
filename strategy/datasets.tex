\subsection{CMS data}
This analysis uses a data sample recorded by the CMS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 13\TeV during 2016, 2017 and 2018 corresponding to $\Lumi = 137 \fbinv$ of data.
Only data that passed the quality certification by all detector subsystems is used in the analysis.
%% and only luminosity sections included in the respective golden JSONs are used for further analysis.
The luminosity measurements are carried out by experts within the collaboration according to the methodology described in Ref. \cite{CMS:LUM-17-003}, for each year of data-taking \cite{CMS:LUM-17-004, CMS:LUM-18-002}.

The samples used correspond to the so called ``UltraLegacy reprocessing'', which contains the most recent calibrations of all the physics objects reconstruction and identification criteria, as well as scale factors and uncertainties.
The simulations for 2016 are split into ``preVFP'' and ``postVFP'' to model the effect
of an inefficiency in a readout chip in the tracker, explained in Section~\ref{sec:APV}, which was resolved during data taking.
%% The MINIAOD format is chosen to perform the analysis.

The analysis relies on five different Primary Datasets (PD),
{\it DoubleEG}, {\it DoubleMu}, {\it MuonEG}, {\it SingleElectron}, and {\it SingleMuon},
each of which combines a certain collections of HLT paths, whose exact requirements depend on the year of data
taking. {\it DoubleEG} and {\it SingleElectron} are merged into {\it EGamma} in 2018.
To avoid duplicate events from different primary datasets, events are taken:

\begin{itemize}
\item from DoubleEG if they pass the diEle %(\texttt{HLT\_EleXX\_EleYY\_CaloIdXX\_TrackIdXX\_IsoXX(\_DZ)} )
  or triEle triggers, %(\texttt{HLT\_EleXX\_EleYY\_EleZZ\_CaloIdXX\_TrackIdXX}) where XX, YY and ZZ are year-dependent thresholds
\item from DoubleMuon if they pass the diMuon %(\texttt{HLT\_MuXX\_TrkIsoVVL\_MuYY\_TrkIsoVVL})
  or triMuon %(\texttt{HLT\_TripleMu\_XX\_YY\_ZZ})
  triggers and fail the diEle and triEle triggers,
\item from MuEG if they pass the MuEle %(\texttt{HLT\_MuXX\_TrkIsoXX\_EleYY\_CaloIdYY\_TrackIdYY\_IsoYY})
  or MuDiEle %(\texttt{HLT\_MuXX\_DiEleYY\_CaloIdYY\_TrackIdYY})
  or DiMuEle %(\texttt{HLT\_DiMuXX\_EleYY\_CaloIdYY\_TrackIdYY})
  triggers and fail the diEle, triEle, diMuon and triMuon triggers,
\item from SingleElectron if they pass the singleElectron trigger %(\texttt{HLT\_EleXX\_etaXX\_WPLoose/Tight(\_Gsf)})
  and fail all the above triggers.
\item from SingleMuon if they pass the singleMuon trigger %(\texttt{HLT\_IsoMuXX OR HLT\_IsoTkMuXX})
  and fail all the above triggers.
\end{itemize}

The used data sets are listed in Table~\ref{tab:datasamples}.%, along with the integrated luminosity.

\subsection{Simulation}
\label{sec:simulation}
\MGvATNLO 2.6.2 \cite{MGatNLO, Frederix_2018} is used to simulate the signal and most of the background contributions.
The simulation of $\PQq \PQq / \PQq \Pg \to \PZ \PZ \to 4 \Pl$ is done with \POWHEG~\cite{Nason:2004rx, Frixione:2007vw, Alioli:2010xd, Alioli:2008gx},
while $\Pg \Pg \to \PZ \PZ \to 4 \Pl$ is simulated with \MCFM~\cite{MCFM}.
The simulation of the hadronization and parton shower is done by coupling the matrix element generators with \PYTHIA~8~\cite{bierlich2022comprehensive, Sjostrand:2015} using the \textsc{CP5}~tune~\cite{CP5}.
The interaction of the particles with the CMS detector is simulated with \GEANTfour~\cite{GEANT}.
All samples are generated with the NNPDF 3.0 (in 2016) or 3.1 (2017-18) parton distribution functions (PDFs)~\cite{NNPDF2015}.
The MC samples are reweighed based on the per-event true number of interactions to match the level of \pileup observed in data as per standard practices.

The full list of MC samples and their cross sections are shown in Table~\ref{tab:listofsamples}.
%% It includes the ones detailed above as well as rare SM backgrounds that result in much smaller contributions to the signal regions.
All cross sections used in the analysis are those returned by the generator and reported in Table~\ref{tab:listofsamples}, with no additional k-factors being used.

The MC samples are employed to optimise the event selection, evaluate the signal efficiency and acceptance and cross check the data-driven estimate of backgrounds.

\subsubsection{Signal}
The signal for this analysis is the production of a photon and two massive vector bosons, one of which is a $\Z$ that decays leptonically.
The hard process of the signal is simulated with \MGvATNLO up to an additional jet at Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) with FxFx merging.
Both of the fully leptonic signals ($\PZ\PZ\PGg \to 4\Pl\,\PGg$ and $\PW\PZ\PGg \to 3\Pl\,\PGn\,\PGg$)
are generated without forcing the intermediate vector boson resonances (e.g. \verb|p p > l+ l- l+ l- a|),
so as to retain off-shell effects and spin correlations among the leptons in the final state.
Tau leptons are included in the generation, but are not part of the signal definition, and are suppressed in the analysis by the kinematic requirements on the Z mass.
No additional studies were conducted on the contamination of taus into the final state.

For the semileptonic signal samples ($\PZ\mathrm{V}\PGg \to 2\Pl\,2j\,\PGg$, $\mathrm{V} = W,\, Z$) an intermediate syntax is used,
with off-shell contributions for the leptonic decay of the \PZ,
while forcing the intermediate resonance for the hadronically decaying boson $\mathrm{V}$ (e.g. \verb|p p > z l+ l- a|).
The decays are performed by \MADSPIN~\cite{MadSpin}, in order to preserve the spin correlations between the leptons and, to some extent, off-shell effects.
The motivation of using the decay chain syntax is twofold, as it allows to speed up the generation and to populate the phase-space probed by the analysis.
The latter is crucial to ensure sufficient statistics.

\subsubsection{Background}
The dominant background for the four charged lepton final state is the production of $\PZ\PZ$,
with minor contributions from massive triboson production.
In the three lepton channel the major background contributions are Drell-Yan processes, $\PZ+\PGg$ production and $\PW\PZ$ production,
with minor contribution from $\PZ\PZ$ production and $\PQt\PAQt$.
The dominant backgrounds in the two lepton channel are Drell-Yan processes and $\PZ+\PGg$ production,
with contributions from $\PW$+jets and $\PW+\PGg$.

$\PQq\PAQq \to \PZ\PZ \to 4\Pl$, with \Pl = \Pe, \PGm, \PGt, is simulated with \POWHEG at NLO QCD (LO EW) up to one extra parton,
using dynamical QCD factorisation and renormalization scales.
Although the fully differential cross section has already been computed at NNLO \cite{Grazzini_2015},
this computation is not yet available in a Monte Carlo generator.
No NNLO/NLO k-Factors are applied.

Aside from the dominant ZZ background mediated by the tree-level processes, there is also a gluon loop-induced ZZ production process,
which is a NNLO diagram and therefore is not included in the nominal ZZ sample.
Though suppressed by the two additional strong couplings, it nevertheless contributes to inclusive ZZ production at the 10\usep\% level.
$\Pg \Pg \to \PZ\PZ$ is simulated, separately for the three final states 4\Pe, 2\Pe\PGm and 4\PGm, at LO with \MCFM 7.0.

$\PW\PZ \to 3\Pl \PGn$, $\PZ \PGg \to 2\Pl \PGg$ and $\PZ \to \Pl \Pl$ (Drell-Yan), %with \Pl = \Pe, \PGm, \PGt,
are simulated at NLO with \MGvATNLO, including off-shell effects.
For the first two, up to one additional parton is included in matrix element calculation,
while for Drell-Yan the calculations include up to two additional partons.

$\PQt\PAQt \to 2\Pl 2\PGnl + \text{jets}$, %with \Pl = \Pe, \PGm, \PGt,
is simulated using \POWHEG
at NLO QCD (LO EW) up to 2 additional partons.

$\PQt\PAQt\PW$ and $\PQt\PAQt\PZ$ with leptonic decays of the vector boson were simulated using \MGvATNLO,
while $\PQt\PAQt\PZ\PZ$ and $\PQt\PAQt\PW\PW$ were simulated with inclusive decays at LO using \MADGRAPH.

Massive triboson production in the channels $\PZ\PZ\PZ$, $\PW\PZ\PZ$, $\PW\PW\PZ$ and $\PW\PW\PW$ was simulated
with inclusive decays of the vector bosons, requiring $m_{jj} < 100 \GeVcc$
using \MGvATNLO at NLO QCD (LO EW).

The subsequent decays of the \PZ and \PW bosons to electrons or muons are performed in \MADSPIN, in order to preserve the spin correlations between the leptons.
%% The FXFX merging scale $q_{cut} = 30\unit{GeV}$ as well as the minimum jet \pt cut $p_{T}^{jet}>15\unit{GeV}$ are identical to the values in the 0,1 jet FXFX sample.

%Leptons are generated requiring $m_{\Pl^{+}\Pl^{-}}> 4 \GeV$ in all samples but \texttt{MadGraph}, in which  $m_{\Pl^{+}\Pl^{-}} > 12 \GeV$,
%and reconstructed  following the same steps of~\cite{HiggsLegacyPaper,ZZXSPaper}.
%Jets are generated with $\pt > 10 \GeV$ and reconstructed following the criteria recommended by Jet-MET group~\cite{JetID}.
