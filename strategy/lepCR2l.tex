\label{sec:lepCR2l}
The preliminary strategy for the two lepton channel is to use a data-driven estimate of fake photons
which, as described in Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds_in_SR}, does not need the data-driven estimate of \nonprompt leptons.

A potential strategy for the estimation of the fake lepton contribution in the signal region of this channel was formulated,
emloying employing procedures similar to those applied in the other two.
The fake rate measured in the $\PZ+\rm{L}$ region is applied to reweight events in two control regions: CR1P1F and CR0P2F.
These regions contain a massive amount of events.
The region CR1P1F in particular has a significant contribution from $\PW+\text{jets}$ events,
while the CR0P2F is dominated by QCD-induced jet production.
The event weights applied to derive the contribution to the signal region are the same used in the four lepton channel,
which account for the contamination of the region with one lepton failing the tight selection from events with two fake leptons.
