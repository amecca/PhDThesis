The relative composition of the diagrams shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ppTo4LG} in the signal sample was assessed in a generator level study.
The study is conducted on the four lepton channel, but the results can be generalised to the other two.
Two samples were generated at Leading Order EW ($\alpha_{\rm EW}^5 \, \alpS^0$) using \MADGRAPH.
The first is the inclusive production of four fermions and a photon, while the other constrains the intermediate vector boson state.

More precisely, the first sample simulates the process $\Pp\Pp \to 2\Pe 2\PGm \PGg$,
which in \MADGRAPH syntax corresponds to \verb|generate p p > e+ e- mu+ mu- a|.
The photon may be attached either to an initial- or final-state fermion line,
but not to a triple or quartic vertex since there are no suitable couplings in the SM for this final state.
The choice of a final state where the two lepton pairs have different flavour
excludes the interference from diagrams with the momenta of two leptons swapped.
The computed cross section is $0.075 \fbinv$.

The second sample forces the intermediate Z boson resonances $\Pp\Pp \to \PZ\PZ\PGg \to 2\Pe 2\PGm \PGg$,
using the syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
define ze = z
define zmu = z
generate p p > ze zmu a, ze > e+ e-, zmu > mu+ mu-
\end{verbatim}
In this case the photon is forced to be directly attached to an initial-state fermion line,
making this a sub-sample of the previous one.
The computed cross section is $0.026 \fbinv$. % $0.027 \fbinv$. % reason: the dRl>0.4 was not applied to this sample

Both samples were generated with the requirement that the leading (subleading) lepton has a transverse momentum larger than 20 (10)\GeV.
Every lepton is required to have $\pt^\Pl > 5\GeV$ and $|\eta^\Pl| < 2.5$,
while the photon must satisfy $\pt^\PGg > 20\GeV$ and $|\eta^\PGg| < 2.5$.
Additionally, the minimum separation between the photon and any of the four leptons must be $\DR(\Pl,\PGg) > 0.5$.

The distributions of the invariant mass of the same-flavour opposite-sign lepton pairs
%% and the transverse momentum of the photon
and the $\DR$ distance between the photon and the closest lepton
for the first and second sample are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:genstudy}.
From these plots it appears that in a sizeable fraction of FSR events the mass of one of the
reconstructed $\Pl\Pl$ pairs is significantly lower than the \PZ peak.
It is also visible that most FSR photons are close to the parent lepton.
For these reasons, the triboson fiducial region, detailed in Section~\ref{sec:FSR_cut},
is defined using cuts on these variables.

The corresponding distributions after the application of the cuts are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:genstudy_cuts}.
The yields after the application of the cuts are reported in Table~\ref{tab:genstudy_yields}.
The application of the cuts results in a reduction
of 36\usep\% and 9\usep\% of the yield in the inclusive and constrained samples respectively.
The FSR component, which is the difference of the two, is reduced by 51\usep\%.
