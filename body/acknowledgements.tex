\subsection{Unacknowlegdements}
CMSSW, and especially its ``build system'' \mono{SCRAM}, made me waste months of my PhD trying to solve pointless issues.
A so-called build system is supposed to ease the burden of specifying where to find files and their dependencies.
SCRAM is somehow able to make it harder, all the while using its own names for things like ``depends on'', ``shared/static library'', ``plugin'', etc.
Its errors are as unhelpful as \verb|each dictionary was never generated [...] add (or move) the specification '<class name="whatever"/>' to the appropriate classes_def.xml|.
This sort of error messages were ``as useful as a fridge to a penguin'' and actively slowed down my development.

\subsection{Acknowledgements}
There are many people who helped me during these three years, with whom I worked, had fruitful discussions,
or who simply shared with me the lunches, breaks, after-work drinks and countless little moments of everyday life.

First of all I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Prof.~Riccardo Bellan, for his guidance and continuous support,
both in my project and in the development of my academic profile.
I already had the opportunity to work with him during my bachelor and master thesis,
profiting from his in-depth scientific knowledge and intuition based on his long experience.
Despite his demanding schedule, he always made time to provide assistance and encouragement,
which significantly contributed to the successful completion of this thesis.

I would like to thank Dr.~Antonio Vagnerini
for his fundamental help in the construction of the analysis strategy and in the statistical interpretation,
as well as introducing and guiding me in the work on the tracker alignment.
With his positive attitude and experience he contributed in making our office a cheerful and productive environment,
and kept me from getting sidetracked many times and taught me numerous things, including how to make the most out of my PhD.
We shared countless hours working on the analysis and on the alignment, and many trips to and from Bologna.

I extend my thanks to Cristiano, with whom I worked in these three years,
for his splendid work on the EFT study and the suggestions, tips and ornithological insights we shared,
which made this journey a little more simple for both of us.
%% \textit{Phasianus colchicus}

Alessandra, for the readiness to help me with all kind of doubts about the analysis, the universe and everything.
Riccardo, Bilal, Chiara and all the other (ex) Torino people with whom I shared my year at CERN, who helped me make the most of it and enjoy it to the fullest.

The theorists from the bunker: Luca, Antonio, Gloria, Andrea, Giorgio and many others.
We shared many moments inside and outside the office;
they put up with my occasional rants about software, politics, energy and just about everything.

My parents Leonardo and Margherita, who supported me in this adventure, especially in the difficult months during the writing of this thesis.

Erika, who was always by my side, despite the physical distance between us at times.
