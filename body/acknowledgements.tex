\subsection{Unacknowlegdements}
CMSSW, and especially its ``build system'' \mono{SCRAM}, made me waste months of my PhD trying to solve pointless issues.\\
A so-called build system is supposed to ease the burden of specifying where to find files and their dependencies.
SCRAM is somehow able to make it harder, all the while using its own names for things like ``depends on'', ``shared/static library'', ``plugin'', etc.\\
Its errors are as unhelpful as ``each dictionary was never generated [...] add (or move) the specification '<class name="whatever"/>' to the appropriate classes_def.xml''.
This sort of error messages were ``as useful as a fridge to a penguin'' and actively slowed down my development.

\subsection{Acknowledgements}
There are many people who helped me during these three years, with whom I worked, or who simply shared with me the lunches, breaks, discussions, and countless little moment that make a life.

First of all my supervisor Riccardo, who guided me and helped me [...]

The theorists from the bunker: Luca, Antonio, Gloria, Andrea, Giorgio and many others.
We shared many moments inside and outside the office;
they put up with my occasional rants about software, politics and just about everything
