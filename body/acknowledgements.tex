\subsection{Unacknowlegdements}
CMSSW, and especially its ``build system'' \mono{SCRAM}, made me waste months of my PhD trying to solve pointless issues.\\
A so-called build system is supposed to ease the burden of specifying where to find files and their dependencies.
SCRAM is somehow able to make it harder, all the while using its own names for things like ``depends on'', ``shared/static library'', ``plugin'', etc.\\
Its errors are as unhelpful as ``each dictionary was never generated [...] add (or move) the specification '<class name="whatever"/>' to the appropriate classes_def.xml''.
This sort of error messages were ``as useful as a fridge to a penguin'' and actively slowed down my development.

I would also like to thank Cristiano, ...
