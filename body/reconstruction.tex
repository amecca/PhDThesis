\subsection{APV25 preamplifier saturation}
In late 2015 and early 2016, the strip tracker of a research instrument encountered signal-to-noise ratio deterioration and a loss of hit detection on tracks, particularly as instantaneous luminosity increased.
Investigation revealed that the problem stemmed from saturation in the preamplifier of the APV25 chip under high occupancies.
The preamplifier's response was linear up to 3 MIPs, but nonlinear beyond.
Lowering the operating temperature in Run 2 unexpectedly prolonged preamplifier discharge time, resulting in charge buildup and a nonlinear response.
This issue was resolved by adjusting the preamplifier voltage bias.

A model for preamplifier saturation was developed and integrated into simulations, improving agreement with data.
Muon reconstruction efficiency was also affected by preamplifier saturation, with adjustments yielding better data-model agreement.
