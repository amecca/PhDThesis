\chapter{Results}

In this chapter the results of
the measurement of the cross section of $\Pp\Pp \to 4\Pl \PGg$, as well as
the search for $\PZ\PZ\PGg$ and $\PW\PZ\PGg$ triboson production are presented
in Sections~\ref{sec:results_4L_inclusive} and~\ref{sec:results_4L_FSRcut} respectively.
Preliminary results for the three lepton channel, focusing on the cross section of the $\Pp\Pp \to 3\Pl\PGnl\PGg$,
are also reported in Section~\ref{sec:results_3L}.
This analysis uses the data collected by the CMS experiment during the 2016-2018 period at a centre-of-mass energy of 13\TeV.
The analysis strategy is to search for excess events over the estimated background yield from known Standard Model processes.
Different identification strategies for the photon and several kinematic distributions are explored.

First the statistical tools used for the extraction of the parameters of interest and interpretation are described.
Then the expected result before unblinding will be discussed, and the best strategy selected.
Finally, the observed results will be reported.

\section{Comparison of strategies}
As mentioned in Sections \ref{sec:evt_photon_selection} and \ref{sec:FSR_cut},
different approaches are used to select the photon
and results are reported both including and excluding the FSR contribution.

Additionally, several event variables are tested for the final fit to the signal strength.

The first is the invariant mass of the $\PZ\PZ\PGg$ system.
It is expected to be higher for triboson events where the photon comes from the hard scattering than for FSR.
Additionally, it is expected to be sensitive to Beyond Standard Model (BSM) contributions, especially in the high-energy tail.

The second variable is the transverse momentum of the photon.
As the $\PZ\PZ\PGg$ mass, it is presumed to be sensitive to BSM physics in the high-momentum tail.

The third option considered is the MVA-based ID working point passed by the photon.
Three bins are defined:
\begin{itemize}
\item \makebox[7em][l]{\bf wp80} The photon passes the \texttt{wp80} working point;
\item \makebox[7em][l]{\bf $\mathrm{wp90} \land \mathrm{!wp80}$} The photon passes \texttt{wp90}, but fails \texttt{wp80};
\item \makebox[7em][l]{\bf None} The photon fails \texttt{wp90};
\end{itemize}
The yield of the simulation is scaled in each bin according to the appropriate scale factors (see Section \ref{sec:photonID}).

This section reports the results for
several combinations
of the aforementioned choices of the analysis strategy.

\section{Four lepton channel}
\input{results/caption-commands.tex} % Template captions for results
This section reports the results obtained for the four lepton channel, which is the focus of this thesis.

\subsection{Inclusive cross section}
\label{sec:results_4L_inclusive}
The first results pertain the measurement of the inclusive process $\Pp\Pp \to 4\Pl\PGg$ with $\Pl = \Pe,\,\PGm$.

\subsubsection{Systematic impacts}
The impact of a given source of systematic is defined as the shift $\Delta\mu$ on the signal strength
induced by fixing the corresponding nusiance parameter $\theta_i$ to its $\pm 1 \sigma$ values,
while profiling the other parameters as normal~\cite{CERN-PH-EP-2014-214}.
This is effectively a measure of the correlation between the $i$-th nuisance and the signal strength,
and is useful for determining which nuisances have the largest effect on the uncertainty.

\subsubsection{Likelihood scans}

\subsubsection{Significance}
The significances obtained with the various strategies for the identification of the photon and the estimation of the fake photon background are illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:summary_significances_inclusive}.
\input{results/significance_table_inclusive.tex}

The best results are obtained using the MVA ID for the photon, in particular the \texttt{wp90}.
The choice of the variable for the fit does not seem to have a large effect.
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:likelihood_scans_inclusive}, the sensitivity is statistically limited
which is in agreement with the observation that the various strategies have expected significances approximately in the same range.
Indeed, as reported in Table~\ref{tab:Run2_SR4P_phoCR_lepCR}, the expected yield in the signal region, using the Loose cut-based ID,
is around 27.5 events, of which 12.8 from the signal sample.

\subsection{Triboson fiducial region}
\label{sec:results_4L_FSRcut}
The following results are derived after the application of the cut
designed to suppress FSR and enhance the fraction of events from triboson production diagrams,
described in Section~\ref{sec:FSR_cut}.
