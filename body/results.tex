\subsection{Treatment of nuisance parameters}
Systematics uncertainties can be categorized into two main classes: the ones that affect only the event yield, and those that have an impact also on the shape of the predicted distributions.
Most of the uncertainties of the first class are parametrised with a log-normal distribution:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lnNdef}
  p(\tilde{\theta}|\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \text{ln} K} \cdot \frac{1}{\tilde{\theta}} \cdot \text{exp} \left( -\frac{(\text{ln}(\tilde{\theta}/\theta_m))^2}{2 \text{ln}^2 K} \right)
\end{equation}
where the parameters $k = e^{\tilde{\sigma}}$ and $\theta_m = e^{\tilde{\theta}}$ are the equivalent of the width and mean of a gaussian distribution.
The log-normal is used instead of a gaussian because it enforces the positive-definite normalization for the nuisance modeled, which is usually multiplying an event yield and thus cannot be negative.
