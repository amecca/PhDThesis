\chapter{Results}

In this chapter the results of the search for $\PZ\PZ\PGg$ and $\PW\PZ\PGg$ triboson production,
as well as the measurement of the cross section of $\Pp\Pp \to 4\Pl \PGg$ are presented.
This analysis uses the data collected by the CMS experiment during the 2016-2018 period at a centre-of-mass energy of 13\TeV.
The analysis strategy is to search for excess events over the estimated background yield from known Standard Model processes.
Different identification strategies for the photon and several kinematic distributions are explored.

First the statistical tools used for the extraction of the parameters of interest and interpretation are described.
Then the expected result before unblinding will be discussed, and the best strategy selected.
Finally, the observed results will be reported.

\section{Comparison of strategies}
As mentioned in Sections \ref{sec:evt_photon_selection} and \ref{sec:FSR_cut},
different approaches are used to select the photon
and results are reported both including and excluding the FSR contribution.

Additionally, several event variables are tested for the final fit to the signal strength.

The first is the invariant mass of the $\PZ\PZ\PGg$ system.
It is expected to be higher for triboson events where the photon comes from the hard scattering than for FSR.
Additionally, it is expected to be sensitive to Beyond Standard Model (BSM) contributions, especially in the high-energy tail.

The second variable is the transverse momentum of the photon.
As the $\PZ\PZ\PGg$ mass, it is presumed to be sensitive to BSM physics in the high-momentum tail.

The third option considered is the MVA-based ID working point passed by the photon.
Three bins are defined:
\begin{itemize}
\item \makebox[7em][l]{\bf wp80} The photon passes the \texttt{wp80} working point;
\item \makebox[7em][l]{\bf $\mathrm{wp90} \land \mathrm{!wp80}$} The photon passes \texttt{wp90}, but fails \texttt{wp80};
\item \makebox[7em][l]{\bf None} The photon fails \texttt{wp90};
\end{itemize}
The yield of the simulation is scaled in each bin according to the appropriate scale factors (see Section \ref{sec:photonID}).

This section reports the results for all of the combination of the aforementioned choices of the analysis strategy.
