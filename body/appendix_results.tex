\chapter{Additional results}
This section contains the detailed studies on the expected results before the unblinding.
The goal of these studies is twofold, as they allow to gauge the expected performance
of the strategies, and to ensure the stability of the analysis by allowing a more in-depth investigation
on the uncertainties and their effect on the signal.

\section{Four lepton channel}
\label{sec:expected_4L}
The likelihood scans and the study on the impact of the systematic uncertainties for each of the strategies
in the four lepton channel are collected here.
First, the studies in the inclusive region are reported in Section~\ref{sec:expected_4L_inclusive}.
Then, the investigations for the triboson fiducial region are detailed in Section~\ref{sec:expected_4L_FSRcut}.

\subsection{Triboson fiducial region}
\label{sec:expected_4L_FSRcut}
The following results are derived after the application of the cut
designed to suppress FSR and enhance the fraction of events from triboson production diagrams,
described in Section~\ref{sec:FSR_cut}.
The target is the process $\Pp\Pp \to \PZ\PZ\PGg \to 4\Pl\PGg$.
